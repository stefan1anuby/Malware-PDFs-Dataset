# PDF Malware Classification Dataset

This dataset, "PDF Malware Classification Dataset," is designed for the development and training of machine learning models to classify PDF files as either malicious (malware) or safe. It provides a comprehensive set of features extracted from a large corpus of PDF files, including both benign and malicious examples. The CSV was created by parsing approximately 11000 malicious PDFs and 9000 clean PDFs.
